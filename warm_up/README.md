# Warm Up
Couple of exercises to get the algorithm juices flowing

### 1. Dictionary of list of dictionaries
Remember what you did in task #0? Extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.
Requirements:
- Records all tasks from all employees
- Format must be: `{ "USER_ID": [ {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ... ], "USER_ID": [ {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ... ]}`
- File name must be: todo_all_employees.json
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if `__name__ == "__main__":)`
